  <h1><a href="/about.html">About me</a></h1>
  <p>After five years in Australia&rsquo;s top digital agencies I moved to San Francisco as the 4th team member, and Head of Design at <a href="http://topguest.com">Topguest</a>. Topguest was acquired by <a href="http://www.ezrez.com/">EzRez Software</a> in late 2011.</p>
  <p>I design interfaces, webpages, products and applications. I build with HTML, CSS &amp; JS. I make (often complex) things simple. I lead small production teams. I spend time wondering how organizations can be lean, nimble and responsible. I often sketch things, and enjoy writing.</p>
