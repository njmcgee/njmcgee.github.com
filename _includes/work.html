  <h1><a href="/about.html">About me</a></h1>
  <p>After five years in Australia&rsquo;s top digital agencies I moved to San Francisco as the 4th team member, and Head of Design at <a href="http://topguest.com">Topguest</a>. Topguest was acquired by <a href="http://www.ezrez.com/">EzRez Software</a> in late 2011.</p>
  <p>I design interfaces and webpages. I build things with HTML, CSS &amp; JS. I create and improve products and applications. I solve communication and structural problems. I work with and lead small production teams. Iâ€™m interested in how teams and organizations can stay lean, nimble and responsible. I know that user experience and web standards are very important. I love sketching and enjoy writing.</p>
