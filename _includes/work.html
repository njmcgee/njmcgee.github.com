  <h1><a href="/about.html">About me</a></h1>
  <p>Iâ€™m a digital designer. I love making things. <a href="mailto:nathanmcginness@gmail.com">Say hello</a> anytime.</p>
  <p>I worked for five years in Australia&rsquo;s top digital agencies before moving to San Francisco as the 4th team member, and Lead Designer at <a href="http://topguest.com">Topguest</a>. One year later (late 2011) Topguest was acquired by <a href="http://www.switchfly.com/">Switchfly</a>.</p>
  <p>I design webpages, products and applications. I build with HTML, CSS &amp; JS. I strive for clarity. I lead small production teams and love organizations that are lean, nimble and responsible. I love writing, language &amp; typography. My pencil is my favorite tool. </p>
