You might have noticed that things are changing at Topguest. A new design, some subtle but important changes to the application, and we’ve just launched the beginnings of a new mobile web experience. 

One of the more dramatic changes is the much brighter color scheme. After applying it to some important layouts I mentioned to the team that we’d “turned the lights on”. This stuck with me, as I worked through problems unrelated to color or shade, and I hope it shows. We hope the new (and upcoming) changes, bring clarity, ease of use, and lots more points!

Things aren’t slowing anytime soon. We’re adding programs and new locations every day, and be sure to visit "http://topguest.com":http://topguest.com on your mobile browser. We’re regularly adding mobile optimized functionality so you can manage your points, and find locations on the go.
