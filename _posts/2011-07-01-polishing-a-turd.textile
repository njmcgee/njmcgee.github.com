<blockquote>And don't say that you're the idea guy. Having an idea is one piece, but it's a very, very small piece.  In fact, it's so small that it's actually better to earn a technical co-founder without the idea in place so that you guys come up with it together. </blockquote>

Excellent advice. It doesn’t matter if you’re looking for a co-founder, a designer, or even working with an agency. Your idea is useless until talented craftspeople get their hands on it. If you let them, they might be able to make it work. If you don’t let them, they are probably polishing a turd, and not enjoying the smell.
