Now we're taking our publishing technology and everything we've learned and are setting off to help design the world's largest book, Facebook.

Facebook continue to build what might become an unrivaled web design team (see "here":http://www.madebysofa.com/blog/facebook-acquires-sofa/ and "here":http://daytum.wordpress.com/2011/04/27/moving-west/) and "facility":http://localhost:4000/2011/06/facebook-analog-research.html.

Great for the hundreds of of millions of Facebook users (and any future Facebook iPad offerings), although it’s a little sad we won’t get to see Push Pop improve on their brilliant work thus far.
