"Eliss":http://www.toucheliss.com/ is an oldie but a goodie, and my favorite iOS game. The game made early and perfect use of the multitouch surface, had an incredibly focused and beautiful aesthetic vision, and an addictive generative quality. Steph Thirion, the genius behind it has a teaser for his new game, "Faraway":http://www.playfaraway.com/. I’ve got a feeling the audiovisual overlap is to feature even more strongly, can’t wait.

<blockquote>
  Cool fact: it was all made in code, it’s an uncut programming sequence. No video editors were used.<br/>
  - The game will come out this fall on iOS. Specific date and platform are TBA.
