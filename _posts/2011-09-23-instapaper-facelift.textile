I love "Instapaper":http://instapaper.com. I use it every day, and it’s kindle integration has dramatically changed the way I read and enjoy content from the web. I’ve always enjoyed seeing unsolicited redesigns so I thought I’d take a quick stab at one.

This is how Instapaper currently looks when you log in:

I spent an hour or two imagining how I might improve things without any fundamental changes to the layout, typography, colors and stripped back philosophy (click for full size):

<a href="/images/posts/instapaper-full.png"><img src="/images/posts/instapaper.png" style="margin-left: 0;"/></a>

I've increased the page width from 750px to 940px to improve efficiency of space while providing more breathing room where needed. New icons are in SVG format meaning the design could be implemented without a single image.
