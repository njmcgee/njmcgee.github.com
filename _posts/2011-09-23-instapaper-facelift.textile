I love "Instapaper":http://instapaper.com. I use it every day, and it’s kindle integration has dramatically changed the way I read and enjoy content from the web.

This is how Instapaper currently looks when you log in:

I spent an hour or two imagining how I might improve things without any fundamental feature changes. Same layout, fonts, colors and stripped back philosophy (click for full size):

<a href="/images/posts/instapaper-full.png"><img src="/images/posts/instapaper.png" style="margin-left: 0;"/></a>

I've increased the page width from 750px to 940px to improve efficiency of space while providing more breathing room where needed. New icons are in SVG format meaning there isn’t a single image on the page.
