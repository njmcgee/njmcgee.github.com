summary: It didn't seem fair to give such a great product only an hour or two of attention, so I squeezed in another two hours. Still not enough, but it’s more fun to show things often, and see designs evolve.

It didn't seem fair to give such a great product only an hour or two of attention, so I squeezed in another two hours. Still not enough, but it’s more fun to show things often, and see designs change.

Again, this is how Instapaper currently looks when you log in:

<img src="/images/posts/instapaper-old.png" style="margin-left: 0;"/>

This time I've added the ability to batch archive, like or delete (could also potentially batch items to a folder, send to kindle etc). I’ve cleaned things up by only displaying the text, share and edit buttons on hover (click for full size):

<a href="/images/posts/instapaper2-full.png"><img src="/images/posts/instapaper2.png" style="margin-left: 0;"/></a>

There’s lots of things I’d love to give further polish and attention, if time allows I might come back to it. We’ll see. Any thoughts?
