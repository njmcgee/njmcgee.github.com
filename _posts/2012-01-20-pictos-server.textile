The super talented "Drew Wilson":http://drewwilson.com/ has just launched "Pictos Server":http://pictos.cc/server/. Similar to Typekit, it hosts the icons you use on your site and serves them as a web font. Should provide great performance & design flexibility, particularly if youâ€™re using something like "SASS":http://sass-lang.com/ for CSS.
