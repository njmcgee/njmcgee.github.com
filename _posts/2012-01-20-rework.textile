<blockquote>Marketing is not a department; itâ€™s the sum total of everything you do.</blockquote>
Currently reading "Rework":http://37signals.com/rework/ by Jason Fried & David Heinemeier Hansson of "37signals":http://37signals.com. Highly recommended. Countless wonderful quotes and plenty of motivation to be found. Thanks to "The Godfounder":http://blog.thegodfounder.com/post/16008574461/marketing-is-not-a-department-its-the-sum-total for reminding me of this one.
