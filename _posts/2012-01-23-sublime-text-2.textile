I’ve used and loved "Textmate":http://macromates.com/ for over five years and I have no serious complaints. It doesn’t bother me that it’s a dead piece of software (in fact it was nice to have something that didn’t change). I have simple requirements, and a elegant and powerful tool that never breaks. As a result I’ve essentially been ignoring the text-editor space (except for the stripped back writing tool "iA Writer":http://www.iawriter.com/ which is very sexy).

"Noah Stokes prompted me":http://esbueno.noahstokes.com/post/15674346663/thirty-five to finally give "Sublime Text 2":http://www.sublimetext.com/2 a try. It’s awesome. You can still "launch from terminal":http://www.sublimetext.com/docs/2/osx_command_line.html, it has it’s own console, a badass command pallete, it supports Textmate themes and bundles and has a nice distraction free (full-screen) mode. Install <a href="http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control">Package Control</a>, <a href="https://github.com/buymeasoda/soda-theme">Soda Theme</a>, and read "this article":http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/tools-and-tips/sublime-text-2-tips-and-tricks/. Also be sure to give the multi-cursor functionality a whirl - it will wig you out.
