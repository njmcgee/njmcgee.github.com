I’ve loved "Textmate":http://macromates.com/ for over five years. It doesn’t bother me that it’s a dead piece of software. In a field where <em>everything changes all the time</em> it’s nice to have something stable. I wasn’t interested in trying anything new (except for the super-sexy stripped-back "iA Writer":http://www.iawriter.com/) until "Noah Stokes prompted me":http://esbueno.noahstokes.com/post/15674346663/thirty-five to finally give "Sublime Text 2":http://www.sublimetext.com/2 a try. 

It’s awesome. You can still "launch from terminal":http://www.sublimetext.com/docs/2/osx_command_line.html, it has it’s own console, a badass command pallete, it supports Textmate themes and bundles, and has a nice distraction free (full-screen) mode. Install <a href="http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control">Package Control</a>, <a href="https://github.com/buymeasoda/soda-theme">Soda Theme</a>, and read "this article":http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/tools-and-tips/sublime-text-2-tips-and-tricks/. Also be sure to give the multi-cursor functionality a whirl - it will wig you out.
