title: Back patting
summary-only: yes

<p class="">Last night I watched designers and developers bitch and moan about the Oscars (and the entertainment industry) on Twitter. </p>

Humor me with a thought experiment. Imagine the general public cared about Silicon Valley&rsquo;s success stories, personalities, fashions and fads. I bet our industry leaders would revel in the glamor and back-patting in the exact same way; Armani suits, designer dresses, bad jokes and millionaires handing gold statues to other millionaires. 

I agree with "Matthew Smith’s sentiments":http://www.the-pastry-box-project.net/matthew-smith/2012-february-23/, “I'd like to see less back patting and more challenging articulate critique executed with a healthy measure of grace.”
