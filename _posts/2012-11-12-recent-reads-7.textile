h2. "A Year of Rdio":http://robweychert.com/writing/year-of-rdio/ – Rob Weychert

A statical anaylsis of how a year of living with "Rdio":http://rdio.com changed one man’s purchasing and listening habits. Some useful insights here, but I’m not sold on his ‘investment’ concept: that buying discrete chunks of music makes us better, more focussed listeners. How about the (totally free) mixtape your first love made you? The band you downloaded because you noticed their t-shirt on someone you look up to? Social factors are far more influencial, and companies like Rdio are in great position to fully realize this.

“The first few years of the social media revolution have been a golden age of tech utilitarianism, where maximizing users' delight was considered, quite literally, the only currency that mattered. In Part II of the revolution, the desired currency is poised to change from attention to profit.”.
