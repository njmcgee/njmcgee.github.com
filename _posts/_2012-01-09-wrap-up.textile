h2. January 

I was on the back of a motorcycle, four beers in my lap, darting through Hanoi’s heavy traffic as the new year begun. My plan was admirable - to find my new wife, and two dear friends a drink to celebrate the passing of another year. Unfortunately the moto driver I’d hired to find these beers and get me back had trouble both finding beers, and locating the spot he picked me up from. I woke for my first day of 2011 with a headache, and still in trouble for not being there to share a kiss on midnight.

We returned to Sydney on the 25th, I had a farewell party on the 27th, flew to San Francisco on the 28th, and started work at Topguest.
