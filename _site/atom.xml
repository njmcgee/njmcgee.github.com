          <p>I’ve loved <a href="http://macromates.com/">Textmate</a> for over five years. It doesn’t bother me that it’s a dead piece of software. In a field where <em>everything changes all the time</em> it’s nice to have something stable. I wasn’t interested in trying anything new (except for the super-sexy stripped-back <a href="http://www.iawriter.com/">iA Writer</a>) until <a href="http://esbueno.noahstokes.com/post/15674346663/thirty-five">Noah Stokes prompted me</a> to finally give <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/2">Sublime Text 2</a> a try.</p>
<p>It’s awesome. You can still <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/docs/2/osx_command_line.html">launch from terminal</a>, it has it’s own console, a badass command pallete, it supports Textmate themes and bundles, and has a nice distraction free (full-screen) mode. Install <a href="http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control">Package Control</a>, <a href="https://github.com/buymeasoda/soda-theme">Soda Theme</a>, and read <a href="http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/tools-and-tips/sublime-text-2-tips-and-tricks/">this article</a>. Also be sure to give the multi-cursor functionality a whirl &#8211; it will wig you out.</p>

          <p>The super talented <a href="http://drewwilson.com/">Drew Wilson</a> has just launched <a href="http://pictos.cc/server/">Pictos Server</a>. Similar to Typekit, it hosts the icons you use on your site and serves them as a web font.

          <p>Khoi Vinh&#8217;s reflects on Google’s new <a href="http://developer.android.com/design/index.html">Android Design</a> creative vision/resource.</p>
<blockquote>What struck me the most about the site, though, is that its vision is so broad that it becomes broadly generic, too. There’s nothing about “enchant me,” “simplify my life,” and “make me amazing” that’s objectionable, but there’s also nothing about those concepts that sets the platform apart from what iOS or Windows Phone are trying to do, either. The design principles are smart and illuminating, and in fact everyone should read them as they offer a lot of good advice. But again you could apply these to just about any design system, whether an OS or a suite of products.</blockquote>
<p>Agree. Impressive content, well written, and a welcome resource (to designers and product people in general). The challenge is in shaping and influencing the platform’s existing developers and product designers. A difficult but worthwhile goal that will require more than well crafted style guides.</p>

We need this to happen at every level: in design schools, in design writing, and in the things we celebrate online and in person. We have a new purpose: elevate design and help change the world. Let’s talk about how to do that.</blockquote>
<p>Yep, a wonderful and lucky time to be a web designer. Let’s not just enjoy it, but make the most of it.</p>

        <title>Agile design? When to be (and not to be) agile. </title>
        
        
        <link href="http://njmcgee.com/2011/10/agile-design-when-to-be-agile.html"/>
        
        <updated>2011-10-27T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
        <id>njmcgee.com:/2011/10/agile-design-when-to-be-agile</id>
        <content type="html">
          
          <p>Agile methodologies were designed to optimize the production of software by focussing on achievable goals, and defending against client or management interference. I haven’t met an (motivated) engineer that has worked in a (suitably implemented) agile environment that hasn’t enjoyed the empowerment, environment, and ability to get things done. If things go to plan, small engineering teams become collaborative decision makers, designers and managers of their own time, and produce results at pace. Sounds great if you’re an engineer right? But many ask, and wonder, how does a designer fit into an agile team or process?</p>
<p>I’ve put together some general tips, advantages, disadvantages and things to avoid:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Agile planning and prioritization can help you. Agreed upon components and pieces of functionality can make interface and visual design wonderfully smooth. The collaborative, democratic nature of this process with a talented team can also be a real pleasure.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>While prioritizing, remember to weigh in if you see design or front-end complexity the engineers don’t. It’s your responsibility to defend and manage your workload. Just because something is a “few lines of code” doesn’t mean it’s easy from a user, interaction, or design point of view.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>Embrace your constraints. You’ll go into a sprint knowing what you can (and can’t) achieve. Use this to your advantage and makes those things awesome.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>Enjoy the protection from clients, hovering art directors and other committees during a sprint. Focus on your goals, and kick ass.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>Remember that further iterations are planned, and are actually going to happen. It’s a reassuring luxury many designers don’t get to experience.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>If you want to work in an agile team, <strong>join</strong> the team. Make sure you’re there for all the planning meetings and retrospectives. Be involved as possible in the front-end implementation (yep, learn <span class="caps">HTML</span>/<span class="caps">CSS</span>).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>You don’t need to be agile if you don’t have interference from above. You can still be nimble, flexible and iterate. Take bits and pieces you find <strong>useful</strong>, when they’re <strong>useful</strong>. Ignore the rest.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>Some things shouldn’t be rushed and don’t benefit from regular iteration. Don’t put them in sprints. For example, it might not be wise to design your company’s logo in a week.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>Relinquish control. Be ready to release something imperfect, with the knowledge that it will improve. Hopefully often, and if you do your job well, to the point that it far exceeds anything you could have designed on your own with an unlimited time-frame. Shipping products regularly has many advantages; learning from mistakes, and gaining user feedback are two very important ones.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>I feel that a typography-first, content-out approach to web design moves us one step further away from the unnecessary distractions of design-for-design’s-sake and one step closer to becoming true typographers.</blockquote>
<p>It’s true. The recent explosion of typographic possibilities paired with the inherit challenges of web design (client-side variations) is re-inventing the technical art of typography.</p>

<p>Holman continues with his “How Github works” series and starts to explain how a company of 42 operates like this: <blockquote>We do things differently at GitHub: we work out of chat rooms, we don’t enforce hours, and we have zero managers. People work on what they want to work on. Product development is driven by whoever wants to drive product.</blockquote></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Design is such an influential part of Facebook’s strategy that Cox and 64 other members of the design staff occupy desks that form a U-shape around founder and <span class="caps">CEO</span> Mark Zuckerberg.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The more I think about it, the more I wonder if Facebook’s business provides the scope for roughly 64 designers (many of whom are absolutely brilliant) to all be at their best?</p>

          <p><a href="http://blog.frankchimero.com/post/9594863189">Frank Chimero</a> and <a href="http://andyrutledge.com/web-design-is-product-design.php">Andy Rutledge</a> recently answered this question with a big fat <b><span class="caps">YES</span></b>.</p>
<p>I completely agree. You don’t get to call yourself a web designer if you’re illiterate in <span class="caps">HTML</span> &amp; <span class="caps">CSS</span> (let’s not get bogged down in whether this is ‘coding’ or not). The discussion seems to come around regularly and it’s amazing that there is actual resistance to this idea (see <a href="http://andyrutledge.com/web-design-is-product-design.php">Rutledge’s article</a> for a succinct rebuttal).</p>
<p>But why do people resist this idea? Do they think markup and <span class="caps">CSS</span> is hard? Set in their ways? Scared it might be a slippery slope into nerdom?</p>
<p>If you’re brilliant enough to design beautiful websites you’ve already spent years mastering typography, composition, content strategy, visual design techniques, and some very complex tools. Learning <span class="caps">HTML</span> &amp; <span class="caps">CSS</span> is a piece of cake in comparison. You’ve got no excuse, you’re obviously smart enough and you’re lucky. With HTML5, CSS3, modern browsers, <a href="http://github.com">Github</a>, <a href="http://sass-lang.com/"><span class="caps">SASS</span></a> &amp; <a href="http://compass-style.org/">Compass</a> it’s not just easy – it’s fun.</p>

<p>Debate is usually an indication of intelligent human pursuit. But not always. One issue for design students—this no-brainer, simplest of issues—has ever been kept alive within the inane realm of debate since it first arose. As such, it is an unflattering indictment on those who contest the simple fact that a web designer must craft markup and css.</p>

Khoi Vinh (previous design director at the NY Times) <a href="http://www.subtraction.com/2011/07/28/unsolicited-redesigns">gives a fairly balanced reply</a> but it’s disappointing that it turned into a discussion about unsolicited redesigns rather than how we can improve online news, which I’d agree needs a thorough re-think.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It’s gobbling up a remarkable amount of talent — an All-Star Team, if you will. The problem with all-star rosters, of course, is that as a team they often suck. It’s an odd phenomenon, but if you put too much greatness in the same room, things don’t always turn out so… great.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Matt Drance wonders if Facebook are taking a risk by putting too much talent in the same room. It’s an odd concern. A individual doesn’t need talent to ruin a good team (but ego might help). This all boils down to the individuals involved and Facebook’s ability to give their brilliant new talent scope and room to work. One thing is for sure, you don’t lower your recruitment standards out of a superstitious belief that an “All-Star team” is going to fail.</p>
<p>To be fair, the article acknowledges this and the leadership challenges involved, but ends by wondering if Facebook can replicate Apple’s design driven success. Why an Apple (or Steve Jobs) comparison is necessary I’m not sure,  but seeing important companies put such great value in design is encouraging to see – no need for alarm bells.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Basically, I came to the conclusion that if I wanted to design great user experiences then that old model of being a design contractor or a studio or an agency would not work. Instead, it’s necessary to be a part of the company that owns the product, to be in a position where I can continually work on and improve the product without the artificial constraints of a services contract.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.subtraction.com/about">Khoi Vinh</a>, the author of popular design blog <a href="http://www.subtraction.com">Subtraction</a>, previous Design Director for the NY Times, and previous founder of a design studio reflects on his recent decision to start his own company (more info on that is said to be coming soon).</p>
<p>Anyone who has worked in a digital studio will empathize with Vinh’s story. A team puts great work into the first iteration of a product only to see the money dry up, the contract end, and a product neglected when it most needs love  &#8211; after real users get their hands on it!</p>

<blockquote>And don&#8217;t say that you&#8217;re the idea guy. Having an idea is one piece, but it&#8217;s a very, very small piece.  In fact, it&#8217;s so small that it&#8217;s actually better to earn a technical co-founder without the idea in place so that you guys come up with it together. </blockquote>
<p>Excellent advice. It doesn’t matter if you’re looking for a co-founder, a designer, or even working with an agency. Your idea is useless until talented craftspeople get their hands on it. If you let them, they might be able to make it work. If you don’t, they are probably polishing a turd, and not enjoying the smell.</p>

        <title>Where’s my equity? </title>
        
        
        <link href="http://njmcgee.com/2011/06/wheres-my-equity.html"/>

        <id>njmcgee.com:/2011/06/wheres-my-equity</id>
        <content type="html">
          
          <p>When I see a very talented (and professionally proven) designer, writer or engineer <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/jmathai/openphoto-a-photo-service-for-your-s3-or-dropbox-a">asking for charity on Kickstarter</a> I can’t help but feel that something is a bit whack &#8211; on two counts.</p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> The creative (or arguably the entrepreneur in this case) is selling themselves short. We often see Kickstarters justifying the amount they are asking for by playing down any idea they will be paid and noting that the money will go towards bills, materials, etc. Why shouldn’t a talented creative, working on a project that people want be paid well!?</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> Where’s my equity? We are seeing start-up costs be funded without any exchange in return. What if Openphoto grows to the size of Flickr? The earliest of angels receive nothing for their investment (in some Kickstarter projects in the many thousands of dollars), or even a promise of being paid back.</p>
<p>I doubt this is the first software project on Kickstarter but it’s come right out of Sunnyvale, and an ex Yahoo/Flickr employee. There’s angel capital flying around The Bay Area at the moment &#8211; I can’t imagine being in a better place to access investors (big or small).</p>
<p>Somewhere there’s probably a line between personal creative projects, and professional or commercial endeavors. I’d suggest it’s somewhere between:</p>
<p>I need more wool so I can knit my grandchildren beautiful sweaters; and; I need $25,000 to bootstrap my new start-up for free.</p>
<p>That being said, I’m not against charitable behavior in creative projects, I understand there’s many without access to capital, and it seems that people want to give, so best of luck to all involved. I’m just confused about who is actually benefitting here.</p>

          <p>It’s great news and more evidence that Apple are willing to lead the way in mobile browser development. <code class="inline">position: fixed</code> and <code class="inline">overflow: scroll</code> are also on their way with iOS 5, but let’s not get excited until Android catches up. Until these handsets enable position fixing and full overflow support we’ll have no choice but to continue to add JavaScript to fake these behaviors.</p>

        <title>Project Spartan - Facebook’s Hush-Hush Plan To Take On Apple On Their Own Turf &#x219D;</title>

        <content type="html">
          
          <p>I’m not sure I buy into this ‘build in the browser to fuck with Apple’ idea. <a href="http://www.apple.com/hotnews/thoughts-on-flash/">Steve Jobs evangelizes HTML5 and standards-based development</a> and Apple backs this up by building the the best available mobile browser (which is probably the exact reason Facebook are working with it).</p>
<p>Let’s say Facebook succeeds with “Project Spartan” and becomes a distribution centre for browser based applications. I doubt Apple would be upset by Facebook (a company with unrivaled reach) showcasing the capabilities of Apple’s mobile products. I also doubt that people will stop developing native Apple applications.</p>
<p>If this is a war, it requires Apple to be against the evolution of browser-based application development. I don’t think they are. I think the quality of their browsers is evidence enough for now.</p>

           <img src="http://njmcgee.com/images/posts/facebook.jpg"></img>
          
          <p>I recently stumbled across the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Facebook-Analog-Research-Laboratory/152917571386966">Facebook Analog Research Laboratory</a>  and I’m really impressed. Working as a designer at a software start-up (if we can call Facebook one) doesn’t usually provoke images of ink, paint, raw materials and hardware.</p>
<p>Although it’s clear that Facebook are currently <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/04/27/facebook-acq-hires-daytum/">working to acquire</a> (and <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/06/09/facebook-sofa/">here</a>) a world class design team, most wouldn’t think of Facebook&#8217;s crisp and minimal design ethos as one that includes decorative practice and paint spills.</p>
<p>It turns out that Facebook (like any big company) use printed materials and physical artifacts for a variety of reasons – events in particular. Outsourcing is expensive, and I’m not just talking about the printing bills, but the administration, the transportation and timing logistics, processing the purchase orders and invoices etc.</p>
<p>Facebook are both saving money, and speeding up the production process. Need some signage for a developer event <em>tonight</em>? Why not design, print and construct them &#8211; right now! It allows the same flexibility and agility we strive to give developers in a start-up environment.</p>
<p>I’m yet to meet a designer that doesn&#8217;t love paper, raw materials and the workshop environment. A workshop like this must also help in attracting (or closing the deal with) versatile design candidates.</p>
<p>But best of all, it encourages, engages, develops and nurtures the companies’ creatives.</p>
<p>Need evidence? <a href="http://www.underconsideration.com/fpo/archives/2011/05/president-barack-obama-at-facebook-tickets.php"><span class="caps">FPO</span></a> profiles the tickets the Facebook team produced in less than 24 for Obama&#8217;s Town Hall event at Facebook’s headquarters.</p>

        <title>Fixed positions with JavaScript </title>

        <id>njmcgee.com:/2011/06/fixed-positions-with-javascript</id>
        <content type="html">
          
          <p>Fixed elements (sidebars in particular) are <a href="http://help.bigcartel.com/articles/22-javascript-ajax">becoming</a> <a href="http://store.apple.com/us/configure/MC723LL/A?mco=MjEyOTY4OTQ">popular</a>. You know those sidebars that wait until the top of window hits them, and they magically stick?</p>
<p>In simple situations (this site for example) <span class="caps">CSS</span> will do the trick. But what if dynamic content at the top of your page changes this calculation (a flash or notification message for example)? Or your header likes to change size?</p>
<p><a href="http://ozanonay.com">Ozan</a> helped me solve this problem, and I thought I&#8217;d share.</p>
<p>We’ll start by selecting said element, calling our custom function, and specifying how far from the top of the page it lives:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="js"><span class="nx">$</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;#fixed&#39;</span><span class="p">).</span><span class="nx">myFixture</span><span class="p">({</span> <span class="nx">topBoundary</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="mi">20</span> <span class="p">});</span>
</code></pre>
</div><p>And our function looks something like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="js"><span class="nx">$</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">fn</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">myFixture</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="kd">function</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">settings</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>

<span class="nx">$</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;#fixed&#39;</span><span class="p">).</span><span class="nx">myFixture</span><span class="p">({</span> <span class="nx">topBoundary</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="nx">topBoundary</span> <span class="p">});</span>
</code></pre>
</div><p>Another (even more flexible) approach would be to make <code class="default-size">topBoundary</code> equal to the <code class="default-size">offset().top</code> of the <code class="default-size">#fixed</code> element on load.</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>

          <p>The Topguest team took some friends to Lake Tahoe the weekend before last. As you can see, it’s a really beautiful part of the world.</p>

          <p>A post I wrote over at the Topguest blog on rapid blog development with <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki">Jekyll</a> &ndash; the same platform I built this blog with. If you’re interested in front-end development I think it’s worth a read.</p>

          <p>Great news. As of August 1st Google Apps (including gmail and docs) will drop support for IE7. If Google can do it, so can I.</p>
