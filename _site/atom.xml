        <title>Agile design? When to be (and not to be) agile. </title>

        <content type="html">
          
          <p>Agile methodologies were designed to optimize the production of software by focussing on achievable goals, and defending against client or management interference. I haven’t met an (motivated) engineer that has worked in a (suitably implemented) agile environment that hasn’t enjoyed the empowerment, environment, and ability to get things done. If things go to plan, small engineering teams become collaborative decision makers, designers and managers of their own time, and produce results at pace. Sounds great if you’re an engineer right? But many ask, and wonder, how does a designer fit into an agile team or process?</p>
<p>I’ve put together some general tips, advantages, disadvantages and things to avoid:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Agile planning and prioritization can help you. Agreed upon components and pieces of functionality can make interface and visual design wonderfully smooth. The collaborative, democratic nature of this process with a talented team can also be a real pleasure.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>While prioritizing, remember to weigh in if you see design or front-end complexity the engineers don’t. It’s your responsibility to defend and manage your workload. Just because something is a “few lines of code” doesn’t mean it’s easy from a user, interaction, or design point of view.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>Embrace your constraints. You’ll go into a sprint knowing what you can (and can’t) achieve. Use this to your advantage and makes those things awesome.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>Enjoy the protection from clients, hovering art directors and other committees during a sprint. Focus on your goals, and kick ass.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>Remember that further iterations are planned, and are actually going to happen. It’s a reassuring luxury many designers don’t get to experience.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>If you want to work in an agile team, <strong>join</strong> the team. Make sure you’re there for all the planning meetings and retrospectives. Be involved as possible in the front-end implementation (yep, learn <span class="caps">HTML</span>/<span class="caps">CSS</span>).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>You don’t need to be agile if you don’t have interference from above. You can still be nimble, flexible and iterate. Take bits and pieces you find <strong>useful</strong>, when they’re <strong>useful</strong>. Ignore the rest.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>Some things shouldn’t be rushed and don’t benefit from regular iteration. Don’t put them in sprints. For example, it might not be wise to design your company’s logo in a week.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>Relinquish control. Be ready to release something imperfect, with the knowledge that it will improve. Hopefully often, and if you do your job well, to the point that it far exceeds anything you could have designed on your own with an unlimited time-frame. Shipping products regularly has many advantages; learning from mistakes, and gaining user feedback are two very important ones.</li>
</ul>

        <title>The Typography-out Approach in the World of Browser-based Web Design &#x219D;</title>

          <div class="clear"></div>
<blockquote>I feel that a typography-first, content-out approach to web design moves us one step further away from the unnecessary distractions of design-for-design’s-sake and one step closer to becoming true typographers.</blockquote>
<p>It’s true. The recent explosion of typographic possibilities paired with the inherit challenges of web design (client-side variations) is re-inventing the technical art of typography.</p>

          <p>I’d been racking by brain to think of a daily design project. Something I can spend an hour or two on – typographic experiments, lots of colors and styles, an excuse to play and build up a library of visual assets. Then it dawned on me. I’m expecting my first child in two months, why not play with some of the names we are throwing around?</p>

<p>Holman continues with his “How Github works” series and starts to explain how a company of 42 operates like this: <blockquote>We do things differently at GitHub: we work out of chat rooms, we don’t enforce hours, and we have zero managers. People work on what they want to work on. Product development is driven by whoever wants to drive product.</blockquote></p>

<p>Where is American (interface) design headed? Fabricant has some concerns after looking at the euro-trashy Windows 7 interface, the “distinctly Disney-esque, almost kitschy quality” of some of Apple&#8217;s applications, and the soft “blandly attractive design language” Google have recently embraced in favor of their previous data driven approach.</p>

          <p>It didn&#8217;t seem fair to give such a great product only an hour or two of attention, so I squeezed in another two hours. Still not enough, but it’s more fun to show things often, and see designs change.</p>
<p>Again, this is how Instapaper currently looks when you log in:</p>
<p><img src="/images/posts/instapaper-old.png" style="margin-left: 0;"/></p>
<p>This time I&#8217;ve added the ability to batch archive, like or delete (could also potentially batch items to a folder, send to kindle etc). I’ve cleaned things up by only displaying the text, share and edit buttons on hover (click for full size):</p>
<p><a href="/images/posts/instapaper2-full.png"><img src="/images/posts/instapaper2.png" style="margin-left: 0;"/></a></p>
<p>There’s lots of things I’d love to give further polish and attention, if time allows I might come back to it. We’ll see. Any thoughts?</p>

          <p>I love <a href="http://instapaper.com">Instapaper</a>. I use it every day, and it’s kindle integration has dramatically changed the way I read and enjoy content from the web. I’ve always enjoyed seeing unsolicited redesigns so I thought I’d take a quick stab at one.</p>
<p>This is how Instapaper currently looks when you log in:</p>
<p><img src="/images/posts/instapaper-old.png" style="margin-left: 0;"/></p>
<p>I spent an hour or two imagining how I might improve things without any fundamental changes to the layout, typography, colors and stripped back philosophy (click for full size):</p>
<p><a href="/images/posts/instapaper-full.png"><img src="/images/posts/instapaper.png" style="margin-left: 0;"/></a></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve increased the page width from 750px to 940px to improve efficiency of space while providing more breathing room where needed. New icons are in <span class="caps">SVG</span> format meaning the design could be implemented without a single image.</p>
<p>Update: further revisions can be found <a href="/2011/09/instapaper-take-2.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>Expands on some of my previous posts on Facebook&#8217;s design strategy. The more I think about it, the more I wonder if Facebook’s business provides the scope for roughly 64 designers (many of whom are absolutely brilliant) to all be at their best?</p>

          <p><a href="http://blog.frankchimero.com/post/9594863189">Frank Chimero</a> and <a href="http://andyrutledge.com/web-design-is-product-design.php">Andy Rutledge</a> recently answered this question with a big fat <b><span class="caps">YES</span></b>.</p>
<p>I completely agree. You don’t get to call yourself a web designer if you’re illiterate in <span class="caps">HTML</span> &amp; <span class="caps">CSS</span> (let’s not get bogged down in whether this is ‘coding’ or not). The discussion seems to come around regularly and it’s amazing that there is actual resistance to this idea (see <a href="http://andyrutledge.com/web-design-is-product-design.php">Rutledge’s article</a> for a succinct rebuttal).</p>
<p>But why do people resist this idea? Do they think markup and <span class="caps">CSS</span> is hard? Set in their ways? Scared it might be a slippery slope into nerdom?</p>
<p>If you’re brilliant enough to design beautiful websites you’ve already spent years mastering typography, composition, content strategy, visual design techniques, and some very complex tools. Learning <span class="caps">HTML</span> &amp; <span class="caps">CSS</span> is a piece of cake in comparison. You’ve got no excuse, you’re obviously smart enough and you’re lucky. With HTML5, CSS3, modern browsers, <a href="http://github.com">Github</a>, <a href="http://sass-lang.com/"><span class="caps">SASS</span></a> &amp; <a href="http://compass-style.org/">Compass</a> it’s not just easy – it’s fun.</p>

<p>Debate is usually an indication of intelligent human pursuit. But not always. One issue for design students—this no-brainer, simplest of issues—has ever been kept alive within the inane realm of debate since it first arose. As such, it is an unflattering indictment on those who contest the simple fact that a web designer must craft markup and css.</p>

<blockquote>During the early 20th century residents of Fort Bragg, California chose to dispose of their waste by hurling it off the cliffs above a beach. No object was too toxic or too large as household appliances, automobiles, and all matter of trash were tossed into the crashing waves below, eventually earning it the name The Dumps. In 1967 the North Coast Water Quality Board closed the area completely and initiated a series of cleanups to slowly reverse decades of pollution and environmental damage. But there was one thing too costly (or perhaps impossible) to tackle: the millions of tiny glass shards churning in the surf. Over time the unrelenting ocean waves have, in a sense, cleansed the beach, turning the sand into a sparkling, multicolored bed of smooth glass stones now known as Glass Beach</blockquote>

<p>Matt Drance wonders if Facebook are taking a risk by putting too much talent in the same room. It’s an odd concern. A individual doesn’t need talent to ruin a good team (but ego might help). This all boils down to the individuals involved and Facebook’s ability to give their brilliant new talent scope and room to work. One thing is for sure, you don’t lower your recruitment standards out of a superstitious belief that an “All-Star team” is going to fail.</p>
<p>To be fair, the article acknowledges this and the leadership challenges involved, but ends by wondering if Facebook can replicate Apple’s design driven success. Why an Apple (or Steve Jobs) comparison is necessary I’m not sure,  but seeing important companies put such great value in design is encouraging to see – no need for alarm bells.</p>

<p>Facebook continue to build what might become an unrivaled web design team (see <a href="http://www.madebysofa.com/blog/facebook-acquires-sofa/">here</a> and <a href="http://daytum.wordpress.com/2011/04/27/moving-west/">here</a>) and <a href="http://localhost:4000/2011/06/facebook-analog-research.html">facility</a>.</p>
<p>Great for the hundreds of of millions of Facebook users (and any future Facebook iPad offerings), although it’s a little sad we won’t get to see Push Pop improve on their brilliant work thus far.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Basically, I came to the conclusion that if I wanted to design great user experiences then that old model of being a design contractor or a studio or an agency would not work. Instead, it’s necessary to be a part of the company that owns the product, to be in a position where I can continually work on and improve the product without the artificial constraints of a services contract.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.subtraction.com/about">Khoi Vinh</a>, the author of popular design blog <a href="http://www.subtraction.com">Subtraction</a>, previous Design Director for the NY Times, and previous founder of a design studio reflects on his recent decision to start his own company (more info on that is said to be coming soon).</p>
<p>Anyone who has worked in a digital studio will empathize with Vinh’s story. A team puts great work into the first iteration of a product only to see the money dry up, the contract end, and a product neglected when it most needs love  &#8211; after real users get their hands on it!</p>

<ul>
	<li>Venture investment peaked in the 1st quarter of 2000 at $27 billion</li>
	<li>Current investment looks to be around the $6 billion mark</li>
</ul>

	<li>A total of 84 tech IPOs in 2009, 2010 and 2011.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>The current number of active Facebook users is equal to the number of total internet users in 2002.</li>
	<li>The current number of iPhone owners is equal to the number of total internet users in 1997.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>Current revenue multipliers look quite high. Facebook at 37.5x ($75 billion valuation at $2 billion revenue), Zynga at 40x ($10 billion valuation at $850 million revenue), Twitter at 55x ($8.5 billion valuation at $150 million revenue).</li>

<blockquote>And don&#8217;t say that you&#8217;re the idea guy. Having an idea is one piece, but it&#8217;s a very, very small piece.  In fact, it&#8217;s so small that it&#8217;s actually better to earn a technical co-founder without the idea in place so that you guys come up with it together. </blockquote>
<p>Excellent advice. It doesn’t matter if you’re looking for a co-founder, a designer, or even working with an agency. Your idea is useless until talented craftspeople get their hands on it. If you let them, they might be able to make it work. If you don’t, they are probably polishing a turd, and not enjoying the smell.</p>

        <content type="html">
          
          <p>When I see a very talented (and professionally proven) designer, writer or engineer asking for charity on Kickstarter I can’t help but feel that something is a bit whack &#8211; on two counts:</p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> The creative (or arguably the entrepreneur in this case) is selling themselves short. We often see Kickstarters justifying the amount they are asking for by playing down any idea they will be paid and noting that the money will go towards bills, materials, etc. Why shouldn’t a talented creative, working on a project that people want be paid well!?</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> Where’s my equity? We are seeing start-up costs be funded without any exchange in return. What if Openphoto grows to the size of Flickr? The earliest of angels receive nothing for their investment (in some Kickstarter projects in the many thousands of dollars), or even a promise of being paid back.</p>
<p>I doubt this is the first software project on Kickstarter but it’s come right out of Sunnyvale, and an ex Yahoo/Flickr employee. There’s angel capital flying around The Bay Area at the moment &#8211; I can’t imagine being in a better place to access investors (big or small).</p>
<p>Somewhere there’s probably a line between personal creative projects, and professional or commercial endeavors. I’d suggest it’s somewhere between:</p>
<p>I need more wool so I can knit my grandchildren beautiful sweaters; and; I need $25,000 to bootstrap my new start-up for free.</p>
<p>That being said, I’m not against charitable behavior in creative projects, I understand there’s many without access to capital, and it seems that people want to give, so best of luck to all involved. I’m just confused about who is actually benefitting here.</p>

        <title>Oxford Writing and Style Guide no longer recommending the Oxford comma &#x219D;</title>
        
        
        <link href="http://kottke.org/11/06/ditching-the-oxford-comma"/>

        <id>njmcgee.com:/2011/06/the-kottke-style-guide</id>
        <content type="html">
          
          <p>Kottke on Oxford now recommending that internal documents ditch the serial/Oxford comma:</p>
<blockquote>The kottke.org style guide still advocates the use of the Oxford comma, but take that with a grain of salt; I also misuse semicolons, use too many (often unnecessary) parentheses &#8212; not to mention m-dashes that are actually rendered as two n-dashes in old-school <span class="caps">ASCII</span> fashion &#8212; use too many commas, and place punctuation outside quotation marks, which many people find, in the words of Bill S. Preston Esq. and Ted &#8220;Theodore&#8221; Logan, &#8220;bogus&#8221;.</blockquote>
<p>Funny stuff. If you get off on discussions about typographic structure and punctuation check out <a href="http://5by5.tv/talkshow/45">Episode #45 of the Talk Show</a> where Gruber and Benjamin discuss logical punctuation. I personally won’t defend Kottke’s use of “dumb quotes” but that’s maybe because pressing <code class="inline">alt + [</code> has become an ingrained behavior when writing a quotation.</p>

          <p>It’s great news and more evidence that Apple are willing to lead the way in mobile browser development. <code class="inline">position: fixed</code> and <code class="inline">overflow: scroll</code> are also on their way with iOS 5, but let’s not get excited until Android catches up. Until these handsets enable position fixing and full overflow support we’ll have no choice but to continue to add JavaScript to fake these behaviors.</p>

        <title>Project Spartan - Facebook’s Hush-Hush Plan To Take On Apple On Their Own Turf &#x219D;</title>

        <content type="html">
          
          <p>I’m not sure I buy into this ‘build in the browser to fuck with Apple’ idea. <a href="http://www.apple.com/hotnews/thoughts-on-flash/">Steve Jobs evangelizes HTML5 and standards-based development</a> and Apple backs this up by building the the best available mobile browser (which is probably the exact reason Facebook are working with it).</p>
<p>Let’s say Facebook succeeds with “Project Spartan” and becomes a distribution centre for browser based applications. I doubt Apple would be upset by Facebook (a company with unrivaled reach) showcasing the capabilities of Apple’s mobile products. I also doubt that people will stop developing native Apple applications.</p>
<p>If this is a war, it requires Apple to be against the evolution of browser-based application development. I don’t think they are. I think the quality of their browsers is evidence enough for now.</p>

           <img src="http://njmcgee.com/images/posts/facebook.jpg"></img>
          
          <p>I recently stumbled across the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Facebook-Analog-Research-Laboratory/152917571386966">Facebook Analog Research Laboratory</a>  and I’m really impressed. Working as a designer at a software start-up (if we can call Facebook one) doesn’t usually provoke images of ink, paint, raw materials and hardware.</p>
<p>Although it’s clear that Facebook are currently <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/04/27/facebook-acq-hires-daytum/">working to acquire</a> (and <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/06/09/facebook-sofa/">here</a>) a world class design team, most wouldn’t think of Facebook&#8217;s crisp and minimal design ethos as one that includes decorative practice and paint spills.</p>
<p>It turns out that Facebook (like any big company) use printed materials and physical artifacts for a variety of reasons – events in particular. Outsourcing is expensive, and I’m not just talking about the printing bills, but the administration, the transportation and timing logistics, processing the purchase orders and invoices etc.</p>
<p>Facebook are both saving money, and speeding up the production process. Need some signage for a developer event <em>tonight</em>? Why not design, print and construct them &#8211; right now! It allows the same flexibility and agility we strive to give developers in a start-up environment.</p>
<p>I’m yet to meet a designer that doesn&#8217;t love paper, raw materials and the workshop environment. A workshop like this must also help in attracting (or closing the deal with) versatile design candidates.</p>
<p>But best of all, it encourages, engages, develops and nurtures the companies’ creatives.</p>
<p>Need evidence? <a href="http://www.underconsideration.com/fpo/archives/2011/05/president-barack-obama-at-facebook-tickets.php"><span class="caps">FPO</span></a> profiles the tickets the Facebook team produced in less than 24 for Obama&#8217;s Town Hall event at Facebook’s headquarters.</p>

          <p>Fixed elements (sidebars in particular) are <a href="http://help.bigcartel.com/articles/22-javascript-ajax">becoming</a> <a href="http://store.apple.com/us/configure/MC723LL/A?mco=MjEyOTY4OTQ">popular</a>. You know those sidebars that wait until the top of window hits them, and they magically stick?</p>
<p>In simple situations (this site for example) <span class="caps">CSS</span> will do the trick. But what if dynamic content at the top of your page changes this calculation (a flash or notification message for example)? Or your header likes to change size?</p>
<p><a href="http://ozanonay.com">Ozan</a> helped me solve this problem, and I thought I&#8217;d share.</p>
<p>We’ll start by selecting said element, calling our custom function, and specifying how far from the top of the page it lives:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="js"><span class="nx">$</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;#fixed&#39;</span><span class="p">).</span><span class="nx">myFixture</span><span class="p">({</span> <span class="nx">topBoundary</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="mi">20</span> <span class="p">});</span>
</code></pre>
</div><p>And our function looks something like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="js"><span class="nx">$</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">fn</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">myFixture</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="kd">function</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">settings</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>

<span class="nx">$</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;#fixed&#39;</span><span class="p">).</span><span class="nx">myFixture</span><span class="p">({</span> <span class="nx">topBoundary</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="nx">topBoundary</span> <span class="p">});</span>
</code></pre>
</div><p>Another (even more flexible) approach would be to make <code class="default-size">topBoundary</code> equal to the <code class="default-size">offset().top</code> of the <code class="default-size">#fixed</code> element on load.</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>

          <p>The Topguest team took some friends to Lake Tahoe the weekend before last. As you can see, it’s a really beautiful part of the world.</p>

          <p>A post I wrote over at the Topguest blog on rapid blog development with <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki">Jekyll</a> &ndash; the same platform I built this blog with. If you’re interested in front-end development I think it’s worth a read.</p>

          <p>Great news. As of August 1st Google Apps (including gmail and docs) will drop support for IE7. If Google can do it, so can I.</p>

          <p>You might have noticed that things are changing at Topguest. A new design, some subtle but important changes to the application, and we’ve just launched the beginnings of a new mobile web experience.</p>
<p>One of the more dramatic changes is the much brighter color scheme. After applying it to some important layouts I mentioned to the team that we’d “turned the lights on”. This stuck with me, as I worked through problems unrelated to color or shade, and I hope it shows. We hope the new (and upcoming) changes, bring clarity, ease of use, and lots more points!</p>
<p>Things aren’t slowing anytime soon. We’re adding programs and new locations every day, and be sure to visit <a href="http://topguest.com">http://topguest.com</a> on your mobile browser. We’re regularly adding mobile optimized functionality so you can manage your points, and find locations on the go.</p>
<p>Any feedback? <a href="mailto:nathan@topguest.com">Get in touch</a>.</p>
