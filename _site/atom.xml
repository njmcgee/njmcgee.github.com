          <p>You might have noticed that things are changing at Topguest. A new design, some subtle but important changes to the application, and we’ve just launched the beginnings of a new mobile web experience.</p>
<p>One of the more dramatic changes is the much brighter color scheme. After applying it to some important layouts I mentioned to the team that we’d “turned the lights on”. This stuck with me, as I worked through problems unrelated to color or shade, and I hope it shows. We hope the new (and upcoming) changes, bring clarity, ease of use, and lots more points!</p>
<p>Things aren’t slowing anytime soon. We’re adding programs and new locations every day, and be sure to visit <a href="http://topguest.com">http://topguest.com</a> on your mobile browser. We’re regularly adding mobile optimized functionality so you can manage your points, and find locations on the go.</p>
