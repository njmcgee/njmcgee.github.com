  <h1>Dear Kevin,</h1>
  <p>You wanted to know more about how I approach design, and how this informs some recent work. Here goes.  </p>

  <p>Design at its most fundamental level is problem solving. This is exactly what most young designers start their career doing. Get your desk, an iMac and let the briefs roll in. Work within the restraints handed down, and achieve the project goals as best you can. Repeat. </p>
  
  <p>It’s an essential experience, but design is more powerful than this - it’s about more than typography, grids, color and form. The best designers, agencies and companies use design thinking to do more than just solve problems. The best won’t accept a brief. Instead, they’ll engage in the decision making process, they’ll challenge the problem handed down and re-frame it. The very best discover exciting problems worth solving on their own – social, cultural, organisational, political, emotional and environmental problems.</p>

  <p>I was lucky enough to learn this early on. My first design job was at an amazing small agency called <a href="http://icelab.com.au">Icelab</a> (be sure to take a look). They are committed to (at least) four things:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>making work fun and interesting, by working on projects that help people, their communities and their environment</li>
    <li>staying small (and thus flexible and agile), </li>
    <li>always learning, and </li>
    <li>using whatever technology or solution best suits the project’s objectives. </li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>For nearly four years, with a team of 3 multi-disciplinary teammates I designed and built websites and applications (front-end and back), designed interactive environments &amp; installations, taught and lectured at universities, designed logos, created motion graphics, designed posters, covers, displays and more. Every project was different, we constantly challenged ourselves, our process and I learnt ten times (in terms of design, and hard skills) as much as I did in university. We tailored our work week, and crammed a week of client work into four days, leaving Friday‘s to work on our own projects, new client-free products, or to go fishing or hiking. <a href="http://decafsucks.com">Decaf Sucks</a>, <a href="http://rentmonkey.com.au">RentMonkey</a> and <a href="http://tumblrthemr.icelab.com.au/">Tumblrthemr</a> are testaments to Icelab’s approach to work and design.</p>

  <p><a href="http://digitaleskimo.net">Digital Eskimo</a> (I encourage you again to take a look, both those compaines framed the way I work today) came next and I was drawn to the studio for many of the same reasons I was drawn to Icelab: 
    <ul>
      <li>Design is central to the company (in both cases the founder/director is a designer)</li>
      <li>A distinct focus and discipline in user-centered design and UX</li>
      <li>the belief (and evidence) that design can change the world</li>
    </ul>

  <p>How did these experiences effect some of my more recent work? Note: with all the work below I was fully responsible for concepts, visual design and front-end implementation.</p>
  
  <p>My most recent project was a white-label solution for United airlines (still a secret, please don’t show anyone). See below the process of sketching out (and decimating) the proposed business solution (1), simplifying and focusing on the user experience (2), and fleshing out the design (3). </p>

  <p>One of the biggest challenges at Topguest was quickly explaining that the services works across multiple rewards programs, and with multiple platforms (social networks). I came up with this carousel (and homepage) design (<a href="http://topguest.com">see it in action</a>). </p>
  <img class="shadow" src="/images/homepage.png" /> 
  
  
  <p>We discussed how much I enjoyed stripping Topguest down to it’s core and designing the mobile web version. See below some of my early sketches, and the finished product.</p>
