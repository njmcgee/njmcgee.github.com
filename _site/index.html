<blockquote>And don&#8217;t say that you&#8217;re the idea guy. Having an idea is one piece, but it&#8217;s a very, very small piece.  In fact, it&#8217;s so small that it&#8217;s actually better to earn a technical co-founder without the idea in place so that you guys come up with it together. </blockquote>
<p>Excellent advice. It doesn’t matter if you’re looking for a co-founder, a designer, or even working with an agency. Your idea is useless until talented craftspeople get their hands on it. If you let them, they might be able to make it work. If you don’t, they are probably polishing a turd, and not enjoying the smell.</p>

        <p>When I see a very talented (and professionally proven) designer, writer or engineer asking for charity on Kickstarter I can’t help but feel that something is a bit whack &#8211; on two counts:</p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> The creative (or arguably the entrepreneur in this case) is selling themselves short. We often see Kickstarters justifying the amount they are asking for by playing down any idea they will be paid and noting that the money will go towards bills, materials, etc. Why shouldn’t a talented creative, working on a project that people want be paid well!?</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> Where’s my equity? We are seeing start-up costs be funded without any exchange in return. What if Openphoto grows to the size of Flickr? The earliest of angels receive nothing for their investment (in some Kickstarter projects in the many thousands of dollars), or even a promise of being paid back.</p>
<p>I doubt this is the first software project on Kickstarter but it’s come right out of Sunnyvale, and an ex Yahoo/Flickr employee. There’s angel capital flying around The Bay Area at the moment &#8211; I can’t imagine being in a better place to access investors (big or small).</p>
<p>Somewhere there’s probably a line between personal creative projects, and professional or commercial endeavors. I’d suggest it’s somewhere between:</p>
<p>I need more wool so I can knit my grandchildren beautiful sweaters; and; I need $25,000 to bootstrap my new start-up for free.</p>
<p>That being said, I’m not against charitable behavior in creative projects, I understand there’s many without access to capital, and it seems that people want to give, so best of luck to all involved. I’m just confused about who is actually benefitting here.</p>

        <p>Kottke on Oxford now recommending that internal documents ditch the serial/Oxford comma:</p>
<blockquote>The kottke.org style guide still advocates the use of the Oxford comma, but take that with a grain of salt; I also misuse semicolons, use too many (often unnecessary) parentheses &#8212; not to mention m-dashes that are actually rendered as two n-dashes in old-school <span class="caps">ASCII</span> fashion &#8212; use too many commas, and place punctuation outside quotation marks, which many people find, in the words of Bill S. Preston Esq. and Ted &#8220;Theodore&#8221; Logan, &#8220;bogus&#8221;.</blockquote>
<p>Funny stuff. If you get off on discussions about typographic structure and punctuation check out <a href="http://5by5.tv/talkshow/45">Episode #45 of the Talk Show</a> where Gruber and Benjamin discuss logical punctuation. I personally won’t defend Kottke’s use of “dumb quotes” but that’s maybe because pressing <code class="inline">alt + [</code> has become an ingrained behavior when writing a quotation.</p>

<p>Let’s say Facebook succeeds with “Project Spartan” and becomes a distribution centre for browser based applications. I doubt Apple would be upset by Facebook (a company with unrivaled reach) showcasing the capabilities of Apple’s mobile products. I also doubt that people will stop developing native Apple applications.</p>
<p>If this is a war, it requires Apple to be against the evolution of browser-based application development. I don’t think they are. I think the quality of their browsers is evidence enough for now.</p>
