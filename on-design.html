  <h1>On design</h1>
  
  <p>The best designers don&rsquo;t accept briefs. Top agencies engage with their client&rsquo;s decision makers to challenge and re-frame their objectives. The world&rsquo;s most adored companies make designers their top decision makers. This is because design is about more than problem solving. The very best designers <em>discover</em> problems worth solving &ndash; social, organizational, physical, political, emotional and environmental.</p>

  <p>I was lucky enough to get a sense of this early on. My first design job was at an amazing small agency called <a href="http://icelab.com.au">Icelab</a> (be sure to take a look). They are committed to:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>working on projects that help people, their communities and environment</li>
    <li>staying small (thus flexible and agile), </li>
    <li>always learning, and challenging themselves</li>
    <li>using whatever solution (or technology) best suits the project&rsquo;s objectives</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>For nearly four years, with 2 multi-disciplinary teammates I designed and built websites and applications (front-end and back), designed interactive environments &amp; installations, taught and lectured at universities, designed logos &amp; identities, created motion graphics, designed posters, book covers, physical displays and more. Every project was different, we constantly challenged ourselves and our process, and I learnt ten times (in terms of design, and hard skills) as much as I did in university. We tailored our work week and crammed a week of client work into four days, leaving Fridays to work on our own projects, new client-free products, or to go fishing or hiking. <a href="http://decafsucks.com">Decaf Sucks</a>, <a href="http://rentmonkey.com.au">RentMonkey</a> and <a href="http://tumblrthemr.icelab.com.au/">Tumblrthemr</a> are testaments to Icelab&rsquo;s approach to work and design.</p>

  <p><a href="http://digitaleskimo.net">Digital Eskimo</a> (I encourage you again to take a look, both those compaines framed the way I work today) came next and I was drawn to the studio for a few reasons: 
    <ul>
      <li>Design is central to the company (as with Icelab the founder/director is a designer)</li>
      <li>A distinct focus, discipline and formal methodologies in user-centered design and UX</li>
      <li>Effectively engages in collaborative design (across disciplines and with all stakeholders)
      <li>the belief (and evidence) that design can change the world</li>
    </ul>

  <p>How did these experiences effect my more recent work? Note: with all the work below I was fully responsible for the sketches, visual design and front-end implementation.</p>
  
  <p>My most recent project was a white-label solution for United airlines (still a secret, please keep to yourself). See below the process of sketching out (and decimating) the proposed business solution (1), simplifying and focusing on the user experience (2), and fleshing out the design (3). </p>

  <p>One of the biggest challenges at Topguest was effeciently explaining that the product works across multiple rewards programs, and with multiple platforms (social networks). I came up with this carousel (and homepage) design (<a href="http://topguest.com">see it in action</a>). </p>

  <p>We discussed how much I enjoyed stripping Topguest down to it&rsquo;s core and designing the mobile web version. Below is an early sketch, and a screenshot of finished product.</p>

  <p>My first job out of college (Icelab) my title was &lsquo;designer&rsquo;. Since then I&rsquo;ve been called many things; Front-end Developer, Front-end Developer/Designer and Lead UX Designer but I think my first job title was the most accurate.</p>
  
  <p>I&rsquo;m a designer and I enjoy solving, re-thinking and discovering problems. I value collaboration. I value small teams. I love product design. Whatever I do next it will be designing (in it&rsquo;s broadest sense) a product that effects people&rsquo;s everyday life in meaningful ways. There&rsquo;s two problems at Instagram I&rsquo;m excited to re-frame, to collaborate and sketch on, to bring to life with design:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Thinking through, and establishing Instagram&#x27;s identity. What voice, visual rules and structures need to be established to expand Instagram across new platforms (the web, Android etc.)</li>
    <li>How will Instagram work on the web? How can an incredible amount of rich content be structured and  explored to build and nurture relationships? What does Instagram look like as a entertainment platform?</li>
  </ul>
